## Project Overview

Fixture Flow is a personalized, accessibility-first web application designed to solve "information overload" in sports tracking. While most soccer platforms overwhelm users with dense layouts and unnecessary data, Fixture Flow prioritizes a clean, curated experience. Users can select their favorite teams and leagues to create a bespoke home screen that delivers real-time scores and upcoming schedules at a glance.
