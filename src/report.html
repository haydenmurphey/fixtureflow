                            <li>URL to GitHub repo: https://github.com/wanghci-class/class-project-dream-team </li>
                            <li>Second item</li>
                            <li>I utilized @media queries in my styles.css to dynamically change layouts depending on screen size.</li>
                            <li>I have at least five seperate pages including index.html, leagues.html, myteams.html, recent.html, profile.html, settings.html and upcoming.html.
                                I utilize the header as the primary way to link pages.
                            </li>
                            <li>I have a main header that links all of my pages together.</li>
                            <li>Similar to above my navigation links are utilized through my header.</li>
                            <li>Included in some of my pages are temporary images until JS and further implementation is added. Each image
                                has a full alt attribute explaining the image and its use case.
                            </li>
                            <li>Passed the Nu HTML Checker and got a 10/10 for the WAVE Accessibility evaluator.</li>
                            <li>I utilized sans-serif for my headers and my paragraphs/li elements were in serif font (there is a comment in css pointing to this objective).</li>
                            <li>Underneath the menu dropdown there is a tab for a profile. Within this page, a form is there for a user
                                to "sign up" with their profile. The form doesn't do anything since no JS is present in the project yet.
                            </li>
                            <li>Under the LEAGUES section there is a dropdown menu that redirects users to the official site of the selected league</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>I believe I have included all required elements for this Milestone 2 submission. I did include some JS under a script tag which can be found in leagues.html but this
                            is the only JS that is included so far throughout this website. I also have a basic framework setup for a profile functionality for users which won't be included
                            in this submission.
                        </p>
